# Technical writting

## Notes

- Steps understand how pandoc works
- I will use this as the mechanism for technical writting

## Ideas

- I think is a good idea using pandoc as a docker container
  for not having installation problems each time I switch computer

- Steps

- Read about pandoc in general
- Follow a technical writting guide
- Check makefiles for doing it recursively and just better [Putt what I learnt if makefiles in it's knowledge space]

## Why

- I want to create a nice notebook in which I can showcase my knowledge
- This will allow me to review it, be proud of my learnings.
- We need to makes things better, things that looks beautiful and is also
  a learning process
